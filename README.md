# WGU Capstone Project

## What is the purpose of this project?

This project is a capstone project for the [WGU Computer Science Bachelorâ€™s Program](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/computer-science.html) program. The purpose of this poject is to create a machine learning model that can predict wether a twitter account is actively engaging in hate speech or not. The model will be able to predict the probability of a tweet being hateful or not. The
model will be created using the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) deep learning framework. The model will be trained on a dataset of tweets that have been previously collected and are available on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com). The goal of this project is to create a model that can be used to predict whether a twitter account is actively engaging in hate speech
or not.
